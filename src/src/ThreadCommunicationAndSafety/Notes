THREAD COMMUNICATION
-----------------------
Without proper communication mechanisms, thread might end up in inefficient busy-waiting states, leading to wastage of CPU resources and potential deadlocks.
Few methods as below can be used to make inter thread communications
 1. notify
 2. notifyAll
 3. wait
 * These methods can only be called inside synchronized blocks.
 * Producer needs to inform consumer this is efficient.


 THREAD SAFETY
 ------------
 * A java object/code can be called as thread safe when it guarantees that there wont be unexpected results and race condition
   wont happen when multiple threads try to access this code/object.
