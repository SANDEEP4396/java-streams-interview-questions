THREAD COMMUNICATION
Without proper communication mechanisms, thread might end up in inefficient busy-waiting states, leading to wastage of CPU resources and potential deadlocks.
Few methods as below can be used to make inter thread communications
 1. notify
 2. notifyAll
 3. wait
 These methods can only be called inside synchronized blocks.
 Producer needs to inform consumer this is efficient.
